/**
 * First-iteration data storage classes.
 * <p>
 * New utilities are always added here first. Breaking changes to those utilities will be added to a new version of the
 * class as applicable. If a non-breaking change is added (i.e., a new interface method with a default implementation,
 * new getters/setters, new utility functions, etc.) the latest breaking change version of the class will be updated.
 * Classes will be marked as deprecated when they have been superseded by a new version.
