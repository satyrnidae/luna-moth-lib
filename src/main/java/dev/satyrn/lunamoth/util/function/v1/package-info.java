/**
 * Provides the first version of various functional interfaces supplied by the Luna Moth library.
 * <p>
 * This package contains functional interfaces designed to be used throughout the Luna Moth library.
 * As the library evolves, breaking changes to these interfaces will result in the introduction of
 * new versions in higher-order packages (e.g., {@code v2}, {@code v3}, etc.).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Users of the Luna Moth library should be aware that interfaces in this package are subject to
 * change and may be superseded by newer versions in subsequent packages. To ensure compatibility
 * with future versions, it is recommended to use the most recent package version where possible.
 * </p>
